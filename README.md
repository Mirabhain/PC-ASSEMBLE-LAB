# PC-ASSEMBLE-LAB

## What I had gained from PC Assemble Lab :
From this activity, I gain new knowledge about how to reassemble and assemble a PC with my teammates. This activity also gave me practical hands-on experience in assembling hardware components. Firstly, I learn the components of the PC such as motherboard, CPU, RAM,  cooler fan, processor, hard disk and power supply. Secondly, I had my understanding of various hardware components, their functions and how components interact with computer system. Through step-by-step disassembly and reassembly of the PC, I gained knowledge about the process sequence of tasks involved in developing a computer system. Plus, this knowledge is valuable for the organization in future project

## Improvement :
As improvements, I think this lab activity need to evaluate the time taken for each stage of the assembly PC. This will help students to identify areas value the time taken for each stage of the assembly.
Effective time management is essential, especially for real-world  practical projects in future
